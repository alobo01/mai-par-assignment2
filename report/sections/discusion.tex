\section{Discusion}
In this section, it is analyzed the plans obtained in each scenario and how they were achieved. In order to provide a insight into the 
efficiency and complexity of the searching process, several key performance parameters were analyzed, as it is shown in Table \ref{tab:tabla}. 

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Problem         & Basic & Substitution & Priorization order \\ \hline
    Plan length     &  41     &    42          &                    \\ \hline
    Expanded states &    33413   &     34710         &                    \\ \hline
    Search time (s)    & 36.0221934      &    58.560908       &                    \\ \hline
    Total time (s)     &   36.0221938     &     58.5609156           &                    \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}\label{tab:tabla}
