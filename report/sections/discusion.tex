\section{Discusion}
In this section, it is analyzed the plans obtained in each scenario and how they were achieved. In order to provide a insight into the 
efficiency and complexity of the searching process, several key performance parameters were analyzed, as it is shown in Table \ref{tab:tabla}.

    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Problem         & Basic & Substitution & Priorization order \\ \hline
    Plan length     &  41     &    42          &        18            \\ \hline
    Expanded states &    33413   &     34710         &  2784                  \\ \hline
    Search time (s)    & 36.0221934      &    58.560908       &    0.9147218           \\ \hline
    Total time (s)     &   36.0221938     &     58.5609156           & 0.9147222 \\ \hline
