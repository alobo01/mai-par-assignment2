\section{Discussion}
In this section, the plans obtained in each scenario and how they were achieved are analyzed. To provide insight into the 
efficiency and complexity of the search process, several key performance parameters were analyzed, as shown in Table \ref{tabla}.

    Problem         & Basic & Substitution & Prioritization order \\ \hline
    Plan length     &  41     &    42          &        18            \\ \hline
    Expanded states &  33413  &  34710         &  2784               \\ \hline
    Search time (s) & 36.022  &  58.561        &  0.915             \\ \hline
    Total time (s)  & 36.022  &  58.561        & 0.915             \\ \hline
