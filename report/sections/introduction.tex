\section{Introduction}

Planning an effective work schedule in sectors like catering or the restaurant industry, where numerous tasks must be carried out quickly and efficiently, can be essential to achieving final objectives optimally.

In this work, we will focus on the design and implementation of a planner in PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) to modelate how a robot performs tasks equivalent to those carried out by waiters and chefs in an Asian food restaurant. Specifically, a total of three problems will be presented along with their respective domains, and an analysis will be conducted on how optimal solutions are obtained in each scenario in order to meet the objectives set for each of the three problems.
